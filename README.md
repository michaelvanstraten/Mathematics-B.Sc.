# Mathematics-B.Sc.

This repository includes a collection of all my problem sets and assignments for
various courses throughout my Bachelor of Science in Mathematics degree.

## Courses Overview

- **[Analysis I](cources/ana-i/)**: Problem sets from the introductory Analysis
  course covering topics in differential and integral calculus.
- **[Analysis II](cources/ana-ii/)**: Continuation of Analysis I, with a deeper
  focus on integration techniques and infinite series.
- **[Einf√ºhrung in das wissenschaftliche Rechnen (EWR)](cources/ewr/)**:
  Introduction to scientific computing, focusing on numerical methods.
- **[Grundlagen der Programmierung (GPD)](cources/gpd/)**: Basics of
  programming, including Java assignments covering fundamental algorithms and
  structures.
- **[Lineare Algebra I (LINA I)](cources/lina-i/)**: Problem sets for Linear
  Algebra I, focusing on vector spaces, linear transformations, and matrices.
- **[Lineare Algebra II (LINA II)](cources/lina-ii/)**: Continuation of Linear
  Algebra I, with more advanced topics such as eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and
  diagonalization.
- **[Lineare Algebra II (LINA II)](cources/lina-ii/)**: Continuation of Linear
  Algebra I, with more advanced topics such as eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and
  diagonalization.
- **[Numerische Lineare Algebra](cources/nla)**

Each directory contains problem sets and assignments related to the
corresponding course. The file names have been standardized to a Unix-friendly
format for ease of use.
